**Instructions:** Build a shopping list with a resource of `item`. Use an array to store the items and assign a unique `id` to each item so we can find them easily. The application should have the following routes:
- `GET /items` to show all items in the shopping list
- `GET /items/new` to show a form for creating a new item
- `GET /items/:id` to show a single item
- `GET /items/:id/edit` to show a form for editing a item
- `POST /items` to create an item when a form is submitted
- `PATCH /items/:id` to edit an item when a form is submitted
- `DELETE /items/:id` to delete an item when a form is submitted
